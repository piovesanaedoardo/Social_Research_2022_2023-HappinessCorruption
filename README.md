Method:
Based on the dataset and the research question, the appropriate method for this project would be quantitative analysis. It involves examining numerical data and applying statistical techniques to explore relationships and patterns within the dataset.

Research Project:
Investigate the relationship between GDP per capita and happiness scores to explore whether money correlates with happiness.

Research Question:
To what extent does GDP per capita contribute to happiness scores? Is there a positive relationship between wealth (GDP per capita) and happiness?

Conduct the Analyses:
    a. Data Cleaning and Exploration:
        [X] Check for missing values and outliers.
        [X] Explore the distributions and descriptive statistics of each variable.
        [X] Examine the correlations between GDP per capita, happiness scores, and other relevant variables.

    b. Hypothesis Testing:
        [X] Formulate a hypothesis: Higher GDP per capita is positively associated with higher happiness scores.
        [X] Choose an appropriate statistical test (e.g., Pearson correlation, regression analysis) based on the research question and the nature of the variables.
        [X] Perform the statistical analysis to test the hypothesis.
        [X] Assess the statistical significance and effect size of the relationship between GDP per capita and happiness.
    
    c. Data Visualization:
        [X] Create visualizations such as scatter plots, line charts, or box plots to illustrate the relationship between GDP per capita and happiness scores.
        [X] Analyze the patterns and trends revealed through visualizations.

Present the Results:
    a. Introduction:
        [X] Provide an overview of the research topic and the importance of studying the relationship between wealth and happiness.
        [X] Explain the research question and objectives.
    
    b. Methodology:
        [X] Describe the dataset used and the variables included.
        [X] Briefly explain the quantitative analysis method employed.
    
    c. Results:
        [X] Present the findings of the statistical analysis, including correlation coefficients, p-values, and effect sizes.
        [X] Display relevant visualizations to support the results and highlight any significant patterns or trends.
        [X] Discuss the relationship between GDP per capita and happiness scores, considering both statistical and practical significance.
    
    d. Discussion:
        [X] Interpret the results in the context of existing literature and theories.
        [X] Analyze the implications of the findings and their potential socio-economic implications.
        [X] Discuss any limitations of the study and suggest future research directions.
    
    e. Conclusion:
        [X] Summarize the key findings and their implications.
        [X] Reflect on the research question and provide insights into the relationship between wealth and happiness.
        [X] Provide recommendations or implications for policymakers or relevant stakeholders.
        [X] Adapt and refine the roadmap based on your specific research objectives, available data, and any additional considerations.
